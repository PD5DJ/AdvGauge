Advanced Gauge is a next level gauge compared to the standard ETHOS gauge widget.

The gauge is more flexible:

## Features are:

- Gauge can be Horizontal or Vertical

- Source input in range mode can be multiplied or divided.
  For example, if you have a source that has values exceeding more then 1024.
  You can divide it in factors 10 and 100.

- Lipo to Percentage calculation.

  - When activated, Range mode is disabled.
  - Take any (Lipo) Voltage Source, enter the amount of cells used, And the gauge acts like a Lipo checker.
